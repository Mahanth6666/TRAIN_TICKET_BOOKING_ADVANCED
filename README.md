# TRAIN TICKET BOOKING SYSTEM

### A Flask-based web application for a multi-role train ticket booking system with MySQL integration.

## Project Description

This project is a web-based train ticket booking system built with the Flask framework. It features a modern, responsive user interface and integrates with a MySQL database to manage user accounts, train information, destinations, and passenger bookings. The application supports two distinct user roles: a standard user and a manager, each with different levels of access and functionality.

## Features

The system is designed with two primary user types, each with their own set of capabilities.

### **User Features**

  * **Secure Authentication:** Users can log in to access the system and log out when they are finished.
  * **Account Management:** New users can easily register for an account to begin using the service.
  * **View Information:** Users can view a list of available trains, destinations, and different class coaches to make informed booking decisions.
  * **Ticket Booking:** Users can book tickets by providing passenger details and selecting from a list of available trains, coaches, and destinations. The system automatically calculates the total cost.
  * **Dashboard Access:** After logging in, users are taken to a personalized dashboard, which serves as the central hub for all activities.
  * **Forgotten Password:** A link for password recovery is provided, though the implementation for this would need to be completed.

### **Manager Features**

The `manager` role has full administrative control over the application's core data. Managers can perform all user actions, in addition to the following:

  * **Passenger Management:**
      * View all passenger bookings.
      * Edit passenger details (name, age, phone number).
      * Delete a passenger's booking.
  * **Train Management:**
      * Add new trains to the system.
      * Edit details of existing trains.
      * Delete trains, with a safety check to prevent deletion if there are active bookings.
  * **Destination Management:**
      * Add new travel destinations and their associated costs.
      * Edit existing destination names and costs.
      * Delete destinations, with a safety check to prevent deletion if there are active bookings to that location.

## Technology Stack

  * **Backend:** Flask (Python)
  * **Database:** MySQL
  * **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Jinja2 Templating
  * **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (implied by the HTML classes)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### **Prerequisites**

  * **Python 3.x**
  * **MySQL Database** installed and running on your local machine.

### **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mahanth6666/TRAIN_TICKET_BOOKING_ADVANCED.git
    cd TRAIN_TICKET_BOOKING_ADVANCED
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install Flask mysql-connector-python
    ```

### **Database Setup**

1.  **Create a MySQL database** named `train`.
2.  **Edit the database connection details** in `app.py` if your MySQL password or username is different from the default:
    ```python
    # Inside the get_db_connection() function in app.py
    con = mysql.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="", # Change this if your password is different
        database="train"
    )
    ```
3.  **Create the necessary tables.** You will need to run the following SQL commands in your MySQL client to create the tables used by the application (`users`, `passenger`, `traind`, `desti`, `class_coach`). You may need to guess the exact schema based on the code's queries.

### **Running the Application**

1.  **Make sure your virtual environment is active.**
2.  **Start the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to view the application.

## ⚠️ **Security Warning**

For a real-world, production environment, **this code needs a critical security update.** The application stores and compares user passwords in plain text, which is extremely insecure.

**Recommendation:** Use a library like `Flask-Bcrypt` or `werkzeug.security` to properly hash passwords before storing them in the database.
